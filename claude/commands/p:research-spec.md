# Rule: Research and Generate Specification Document

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in researching a user's idea and creating a focused, practical specification document in Markdown format with YAML front-matter. This document will serve as input to downstream task generation commands. Think harder.

## Research Approach

This command uses a standard research depth approach to create comprehensive specification documents that include:

1. **Core functionality analysis** based on research findings and feature characteristics
2. **Appropriate technical depth** matching the requirements
3. **Integration considerations** for existing codebase patterns
4. **Standard quality requirements** for production-ready features

## Input

Consider any input from $ARGUMENTS

The user will provide:

1. **Idea/Feature Description:** Initial concept or problem statement that needs research

## Instructions

The AI will need to:

1. Analyze the user's idea for completeness and scope
2. Conduct comprehensive research on the feature
3. Ask clarifying questions if critical information is missing
4. Generate a complete specification document

## Process

1. **Initial Research:** Conduct preliminary research to understand the idea's scope and characteristics
2. **Requirements Analysis:** Based on research findings:
   - Analyze impact scope and integration needs
   - Identify functional requirements
   - Assess technical constraints and decisions
   - Evaluate integration complexity
3. **Deep Research Phase:** Conduct comprehensive research covering:
   - Core functionality and integration patterns
   - Testing approaches and security considerations
   - Performance considerations and reliability features
   - Implementation planning and dependencies
4. **Generate Specification:** Create complete document with all necessary sections
5. **Save Specification:** Save as `research-spec-[idea-name].md` in `/tasks/` directory
6. **End Command:** The command completes after saving the specification. Task generation and implementation are separate phases.

## Research Areas

The research should comprehensively cover:

### Core Research (Always Include)

- Existing implementations and design patterns
- Framework and library recommendations (from current codebase)
- Integration with existing systems
- User journey and interface patterns
- Existing code patterns and conventions
- Available utilities and shared components

### Technical Research

- Data modeling requirements
- Security considerations (input validation, authentication, authorization)
- Testing approaches (unit, integration, e2e tests)
- Error handling patterns and edge cases
- Configuration and environment requirements

### Production Readiness Research

- Performance considerations and optimization opportunities
- Security best practices and compliance needs
- Reliability and resilience features
- Monitoring and observability requirements
- Deployment considerations and CI/CD integration
- Backward compatibility requirements (if applicable)

## Clarifying Questions (Only When Needed)

Ask questions using letter/number lists for easy selection. Examples:

**If problem scope is unclear:**
"To better research this idea, I need to understand the scope. Which best describes your vision?
A) A simple feature addition to existing system  
B) An enhancement to current functionality
C) A complete standalone application
D) A developer tool or utility"

**If target users are ambiguous:**
"Who is the primary user for this feature?
A) End users (customers/clients)
B) Internal team members
C) Developers/technical users
D) System administrators"

**If backward compatibility might be relevant:**
"Are there backward compatibility requirements?
A) No - can break existing interfaces
B) Yes - must maintain existing API compatibility
C) Partial - some breaking changes acceptable
D) Not applicable"

## Specification Template
