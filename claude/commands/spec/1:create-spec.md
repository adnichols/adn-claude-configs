# Rule: Research and Generate Specification Document

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in researching a user's idea and creating a focused, practical specification document in Markdown format with YAML front-matter. This document will serve as input to downstream task generation commands.

## Research Approach

This command uses a standard research depth approach to create comprehensive specification documents that include:

1. **Core functionality analysis** based on research findings and feature characteristics
2. **Appropriate technical depth** matching the requirements
3. **Integration considerations** for existing codebase patterns
4. **Standard quality requirements** for production-ready features

## Input

Consider any input from $ARGUMENTS

The user will provide:

1. **Idea/Feature Description:** Initial concept or problem statement that needs research

## Determine Specification Depth

Before starting research, determine the appropriate level of detail:

**Ask the user:**
"What level of specification detail do you need for this feature?

A) **Simple** - Basic technical approach, core functionality, and integration points only
B) **Standard** - Full technical design with testing, security, and implementation planning
C) **Comprehensive** - Enterprise-grade with compliance, monitoring, risk analysis, and migration
D) **Let me assess** - Analyze the feature and recommend appropriate depth"

**Depth Guidelines:**

- **Simple**: 6-8 sections (Executive Summary, Problem/Solution, Technical Design, Testing, Implementation Plan, References)
- **Standard**: 10-12 sections (adds Security, Performance, Compatibility)
- **Comprehensive**: Full 14-section template (adds Compliance, Monitoring, Risk Analysis, Migration)

## Instructions

The AI will need to:

1. Determine specification depth based on user input or feature analysis
2. Analyze the user's idea for completeness and scope
3. Conduct research appropriate to the chosen depth level
4. Ask clarifying questions if critical information is missing
5. Generate a complete specification document tailored to the depth level

## Process

1. **Initial Research:** Conduct preliminary research to understand the idea's scope and characteristics

2. **Codebase Analysis:** Systematically analyze the existing codebase for context:
   - Use Glob to find similar implementations: `**/*[feature-pattern]*`
   - Use Grep to locate relevant patterns, utilities, and conventions
   - Identify existing APIs, services, and integration points
   - Review testing infrastructure and patterns
   - Document build, deployment, and configuration patterns
   - **Use parallel tool calls** to read multiple files simultaneously for faster analysis
   - Compile findings into "Integration Points" section of spec

3. **Requirements Analysis:** Based on research findings and codebase analysis:
   - Analyze impact scope and integration needs
   - Identify functional requirements
   - Assess technical constraints and decisions
   - Evaluate integration complexity

4. **Deep Research Phase:** Conduct comprehensive research appropriate to chosen depth level:
   - Core functionality and integration patterns (all depths)
   - Testing approaches and security considerations (standard and comprehensive)
   - Performance considerations and reliability features (standard and comprehensive)
   - Implementation planning and dependencies (all depths)
   - Compliance, monitoring, and risk analysis (comprehensive only)

5. **Generate Specification:** Create complete document with sections appropriate to depth level

6. **Validate Specification Completeness:**
   - Verify all required sections for chosen depth level are present
   - Check that codebase analysis findings are incorporated
   - Confirm YAML front-matter is complete and correct
   - Validate that research addresses the user's original idea
   - Mark specification as complete in final section

7. **Save Specification:** Save as `research-spec-[idea-name].md` in `/tasks/` directory

8. **End Command:** The command completes after saving the specification. Task generation and implementation are separate phases.

## Research Areas

The research should comprehensively cover:

### Core Research (Always Include)

- Existing implementations and design patterns
- Framework and library recommendations (from current codebase)
- Integration with existing systems
- User journey and interface patterns
- Existing code patterns and conventions
- Available utilities and shared components

### Technical Research

- Data modeling requirements
- Security considerations (input validation, authentication, authorization)
- Testing approaches (unit, integration, e2e tests)
- Error handling patterns and edge cases
- Configuration and environment requirements

### Production Readiness Research

- Performance considerations and optimization opportunities
- Security best practices and compliance needs
- Reliability and resilience features
- Monitoring and observability requirements
- Deployment considerations and CI/CD integration
- Backward compatibility requirements (if applicable)

## Clarifying Questions (Only When Needed)

Ask questions using letter/number lists for easy selection. Examples:

**If problem scope is unclear:**
"To better research this idea, I need to understand the scope. Which best describes your vision?
A) A simple feature addition to existing system  
B) An enhancement to current functionality
C) A complete standalone application
D) A developer tool or utility"

**If target users are ambiguous:**
"Who is the primary user for this feature?
A) End users (customers/clients)
B) Internal team members
C) Developers/technical users
D) System administrators"

**If backward compatibility might be relevant:**
"Are there backward compatibility requirements?
A) No - can break existing interfaces
B) Yes - must maintain existing API compatibility
C) Partial - some breaking changes acceptable
D) Not applicable"

## Specification Template

The specification document uses this structure (sections vary by depth level):

```markdown
---
spec_type: technical_specification
complexity_level: [simple|standard|comprehensive]
fidelity_mode: strict
agents:
  developer: developer-fidelity
  reviewer: quality-reviewer-fidelity
