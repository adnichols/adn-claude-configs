# Rule: Direct Specification to Task Conversion with Full Fidelity

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in converting a detailed specification document (created through collaborative planning) directly into executable task lists while preserving 100% fidelity to the original specification. This command bypasses complexity systems and PRD conversion to maintain exact scope boundaries and requirements as specified.

## Core Principle: Specification Fidelity

**The specification is the absolute authority.** This command:

- Adds ZERO requirements beyond the specification
- Makes NO scope expansions or "improvements"
- Preserves ALL original decisions and constraints
- Creates tasks that implement EXACTLY what's written
- Uses fidelity-preserving agents that cannot modify scope

## Input

The user will provide:

1. **Specification File Path:** Path to the detailed specification document. This may be provided in $ARGUMENTS

## Process

1. **Validate Specification:** Before reading, verify specification is ready:
   - Check specification file exists at provided path
   - Confirm file is readable and properly formatted markdown
   - Parse YAML front-matter (if present) for:
     - `fidelity_mode`: Should be "strict"
     - `agents`: Extract developer and reviewer agent specifications
     - `complexity_level`: Note the chosen depth (simple/standard/comprehensive)
     - `codebase_analyzed`: Verify codebase analysis was performed
   - Verify specification has completion marker in final section
   - If validation fails, report specific error and halt
   - If successful, extract metadata for use in task generation

2. **Read Specification Completely:** Parse the entire specification document to understand:

   - All functional requirements
   - All technical constraints and decisions
   - Stated testing requirements (if any)
   - Stated security requirements (if any)
   - Performance requirements and success criteria
   - Implementation timeline and phases
   - Resource constraints
   - Explicit scope boundaries (what's included/excluded)

3. **Analyze Implementation Context:** Systematically discover files that will be affected:
   - Use Glob to find files matching patterns mentioned in spec: `**/*[pattern]*`
   - Use Grep to search for relevant classes, functions, and APIs mentioned in spec
   - Identify files that will need:
     - Creation (new files)
     - Modification (existing files)
     - Integration (connection points)
   - **Use parallel tool calls** for faster file discovery
   - Populate "Implementation Files" section with:
     - File paths
     - Current status (exists/new)
     - Purpose (based on spec requirements)
     - Estimated scope of changes
   - Document integration points and dependencies discovered

4. **Extract Task Structure:** Identify natural implementation phases from the specification:

   - Use specification's own phase structure if provided
   - Create logical groupings based on specification content
   - Maintain specification's dependencies
   - Preserve specification's success criteria for each phase

5. **Generate Task List:** Create tasks that implement:

   - ONLY what's explicitly stated in the specification
   - Testing ONLY as specified (not more, not less)
   - Security ONLY as specified (not more, not less)
   - Performance measures ONLY as specified
   - Documentation ONLY as specified
   - Include discovered implementation files from step 3
   - Use YAML front-matter from specification for metadata continuity

6. **Validate Task Coverage:** Before saving, verify task completeness:
   - Check all specification requirements have corresponding tasks
   - Verify no scope expansion beyond specification
   - Confirm task phases match specification structure
   - Validate that testing/security tasks match specification level
   - Ensure implementation files section is populated with discoveries
   - Check YAML front-matter is complete:
     - Source specification path
     - Fidelity mode (from spec)
     - Agent specifications (from spec)
     - Complexity level (from spec)
   - If validation finds gaps, report to user for clarification
   - If validation passes, proceed to save

7. **Save and Report:** Save validated task list:
   - Save tasks to `/tasks/tasks-fidelity-[spec-name].md`
   - Report validation results to user
   - Confirm task list is ready for processing (spec/3:process-tasks)
   - Inform user of file location for review

## Final Task File Format

The final task file at `/tasks/tasks-fidelity-[spec-name].md`:

```markdown
---
source_specification: [path to spec file]
fidelity_mode: strict
complexity_level: [simple|standard|comprehensive - from spec]
agents:
  developer: developer-fidelity
  reviewer: quality-reviewer-fidelity
created: [timestamp YYYY-MM-DD]
validated: true

# [Specification Title] - Fidelity Implementation Tasks

## üéØ Implementation Authority

**Source Specification:** `[path to spec file]`
**Implementation Scope:** Exactly as specified, no additions or modifications
**Complexity Level:** [simple|standard|comprehensive]
**Validation Status:** ‚úÖ Task coverage validated against specification

### Specification Summary

[Brief summary of what's being implemented - extracted from spec]

### Implementation Boundaries

**Included:** [What specification explicitly includes]
**Excluded:** [What specification explicitly excludes]
**Testing Level:** [As specified in original document]
**Security Level:** [As specified in original document]
**Documentation Level:** [As specified in original document]

## üóÇÔ∏è Implementation Files

*Discovered through systematic codebase analysis (Glob/Grep)*

### Files to Create
- `path/to/new/file1.ext` - [Purpose from spec]
- `path/to/new/file2.ext` - [Purpose from spec]

### Files to Modify
