# Claude Code Configuration Repository

A comprehensive Claude Code configuration system that provides specialized agents, custom commands, and complete development workflows for building software with AI assistance.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

This repository supports installation for both **Claude Code** and **Codex**.

#### Option 1: Install to a Project

```bash
# Clone this repository (if not already done)
git clone <repository-url>
cd adn-claude-configs

# Install Python dependencies for docs-fetch commands
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# Install to your project
cd /path/to/your/project

# Install Claude Code only
bash /path/to/adn-claude-configs/scripts/install.sh --claude

# Install Codex only
bash /path/to/adn-claude-configs/scripts/install.sh --codex

# Install both
bash /path/to/adn-claude-configs/scripts/install.sh --all
```

#### Option 2: Install Globally (to Home Directory)

```bash
# Install to ~/.claude and ~/.codex for global access
bash /path/to/adn-claude-configs/scripts/install.sh --all ~
```

This creates `.claude/` and `.codex/` directories with all agents, commands/prompts, and configurations.

### Updating Existing Installations

To sync the latest changes from this repository to your installed configurations:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
bash /path/to/adn-claude-configs/scripts/update.sh
```

The update script:
- Auto-detects which tools are installed (Claude Code and/or Codex)
- Updates agents, commands/prompts, and scripts
- Preserves your local settings and configuration files
- Skips CLAUDE.md and CODEX.md (generated by codex)

## 🧠 Fidelity-Preserving System

This repository features a **Fidelity-Preserving System** that automatically:

- **Preserves exact scope** from requirements through implementation
- **Uses fidelity-preserving agents** for implementation and quality review
- **Prevents scope creep** by maintaining strict adherence to specifications
- **Ensures quality** through comprehensive validation while staying within scope

### Agent Types

| Purpose | Agent Type | Validation Requirements |
|---------|------------|------------------------|
| **Implementation** | `developer-fidelity` | Lint + Build + Secrets + Unit Tests |
| **Quality Review** | `quality-reviewer-fidelity` | Production readiness validation |
| **Fidelity Check** | `fidelity-reviewer` | Specification compliance validation |

The system emphasizes scope preservation and exact requirement implementation over complexity-based branching.

```

**Specification-Based Development** (Direct from specs):

```
[Detailed Spec] → /p:spec-to-tasks → /b:process-tasks → /p:review
```

**Research-Based Development** (From research documents):

```
[Research Doc] → /p:research-spec → /p:spec-to-tasks → /b:process-tasks → /p:review
```

### 3. Code Quality Workflows

**Simplification Workflow**:

```
/simplify:create-plan → @quality-reviewer → /simplify:process-plan
```

**Quality Assurance**:

```
/p:review → [Fix Issues] → [Re-review] → [Approve for PR]
```

## 🔄 Usage Patterns

### Fetching Documentation

The `/docs:fetch` command transforms scattered online documentation into locally stored, AI-friendly Markdown files for enhanced Claude Code integration:

1. **Basic usage**:

   ```bash
   /docs:fetch react
   # Fetches React documentation to /workspace/docs/frameworks/react/
   ```

2. **Advanced options**:

   ```bash
   /docs:fetch typescript --version 5.3
   # Fetch specific version

   /docs:fetch lodash --sections api
   # Fetch only API reference sections
   
   /docs:fetch vue --update
   # Update existing documentation
   
   /docs:fetch express --format minimal
   # Use condensed format
   ```

3. **Generated structure**:

   ```
   /workspace/docs/
   ├── libraries/lodash/
   ├── frameworks/react/
   └── languages/typescript/
       ├── index.md              # Overview and navigation
       ├── api-reference.md      # Complete API documentation  
       ├── best-practices.md     # Current patterns and conventions
       └── examples/             # Code examples and tutorials
   ```

**Features:**
- **AI-Optimized**: Content processed by Technical Writer agent for Claude Code understanding
- **Self-Learning**: Automatically discovers and saves site patterns for future use
- **Quality Validation**: Comprehensive content analysis with completeness metrics
- **Error Recovery**: Robust retry logic with exponential backoff
- **Enhanced Fetching**: Smart handling of JavaScript-heavy documentation sites

### Creating New Features

1. **Start with requirements gathering**:

   ```bash
   /p:create-prd
   # Follow interactive prompts to create detailed PRD
   ```

2. **Build out the task lists**:
  
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/new-feature # optional, claude should do this
   /p:gen-tasks @path-to-prd.md
   # Generate parent tasks, review, and then say "Go" to build sub-tasks.
   # Should detect if you are on a branch and create one if not
   ```

3. **Process the implementation**:

   ```bash
   /b:process-tasks @path-to-task-list.md
   # Processes PRD tasks one at a time with fidelity preservation

   # Or, if you want no confirmation prompts
   /b:process-tasks @path-to-task-list.md NOSUBCONF
   ```

4. **Quality review**:

   ```bash
   /p:review
   # Comprehensive pre-PR quality check
   ```

5. **Generate documentation**:

   ```bash
   /docs:update
   # Creates user and technical documentation
   ```

### Working with Research

1. **Convert research to specification**:

   ```bash
   /p:research-spec @research-idea-description.md
   # Converts research ideas into comprehensive specification documents
   ```

2. **Convert specification to tasks**:

   ```bash
   /p:spec-to-tasks @research-spec-file.md
   # Converts specifications to detailed task lists with fidelity preservation
   ```

3. **Execute with full context**:

   ```bash
   /b:process-tasks @fidelity-task-list.md
   # Preserves all specification context during implementation
   ```

### Code Simplification

1. **Analyze for improvements**:

   ```bash
   /simplify:create-plan
   # Creates detailed simplification plan
   ```

2. **Review with quality agent**:

   ```bash
   @quality-reviewer @refactor-plan.md
   ```

3. **Execute approved changes**:

   ```bash
   /simplify:process-plan @refactor-task-list.md
   ```

## 📖 Best Practices

### Git Workflow Requirements

- **Always work on feature branches** (never directly on main)
- **One sub-task at a time** unless `NOSUBCONF` is specified
- **Tests must pass** before any commits
- **Conventional commit format** is automatically applied

### Task Processing Guidelines

- Use `NOSUBCONF` parameter for batch processing when appropriate
- Provide clear, actionable task descriptions
- Break complex features into phases with clear boundaries
- Include test requirements in all implementation tasks

### Quality Standards

- All agents reference CLAUDE.md for project-specific standards
- Documentation is generated after implementation, not before

## 🔌 MCP Server Configuration

This repository includes pre-configured MCP (Model Context Protocol) server definitions.

### For Claude Code

MCP servers are defined in `claude/mcp-servers.json`. To use them:

1. **Project-level**: Installed automatically to `.claude/mcp-servers.json`
2. **Claude Desktop App**: Merge into `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS)
3. **Global Claude Code**: Ensure `enableAllProjectMcpServers: true` in `~/.claude/settings.json`

### For Codex

MCP servers are defined in `codex/mcp-servers.toml`. To use them:

1. **Merge into config**: Copy `[mcp_servers.*]` sections into your `~/.codex/config.toml`
2. **Project-level**: Add to project's `.codex/config.toml`

### Example MCP Servers

The repository includes the Playwright MCP server by default. Add more as needed:

```json
// Claude Code (JSON)
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@playwright/mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

```toml
# Codex (TOML)
[mcp_servers.playwright]
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "@playwright/mcp@latest"]
```

## 📝 Installation Notes

- **CLAUDE.md and CODEX.md are NOT installed** - Codex generates these files based on your project
- **Settings are preserved** - The update script never overwrites your local settings files
- **Source directories remain** - `agents/` and `commands/` are maintained as the source of truth
- **Both tools supported** - Install Claude Code, Codex, or both to the same project
