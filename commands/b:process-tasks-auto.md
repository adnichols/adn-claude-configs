# Instructions

Process the task list using the fidelity-preserving approach to maintain exact scope as specified in the source document. This command uses developer-fidelity and quality-reviewer-fidelity agents to implement only what's explicitly specified, without additions or scope expansions.
$ARGUMENTS. Think harder.

## Fidelity Preservation Process

Before starting task implementation:

1. **Parse Task File Metadata:** Extract fidelity information from task file YAML front-matter
2. **Use Fidelity Agents:** Always use fidelity-preserving agents for implementation:
   - Developer agent: `@developer-fidelity`
   - Quality reviewer: `@quality-reviewer-fidelity`
3. **Apply Only Specified Validation:** Include only the testing and validation explicitly specified in the source document:
   - Review source document for testing requirements
   - Implement only specified security measures
   - Do not add tests or validation beyond what's explicitly required

<skip_subtask_confirmation>
If $ARGUMENTS contains NOSUBCONF then skip all phase confirmation prompts described below.
</skip_subtask_confirmation>

# Task List Management

Guidelines for managing task lists in markdown files to track progress on completing source document implementations

## Task Implementation

## Critical Task Update Protocol

**MANDATORY CHECKPOINT SYSTEM:** After completing ANY subtask, Claude MUST follow this exact sequence:

1. **Declare completion with mandatory update statement:**
   "‚úÖ Subtask [X.Y] [task name] completed.
   üîÑ UPDATING MARKDOWN FILE NOW..."

2. **Immediately perform the markdown update:**

- Use Edit tool to change `- [ ] X.Y [task name]` to `- [x] X.Y [task name]`
- Show the actual edit operation in the response

3. **Confirm update completion:**
   "‚úÖ Markdown file updated: [ ] ‚Üí [x] for subtask X.Y
   üìã Task list is now current."

After Step 3, continue working through the remaining subtasks in the current phase without pausing for user confirmation.

**PHASE CONFIRMATION PROTOCOL:** Claude must pause only at phase boundaries unless the user explicitly authorizes completing multiple phases in one go.

1. **Default behavior:** Finish every subtask inside the current phase, then:
   - Summarize completed work and show the relevant markdown updates.
   - Ask: "Phase [N] complete. Proceed to the next phase? (y/n)"
2. **User-directed multi-phase runs:** If the user instructs Claude to complete several phases at once (e.g., "complete phases 1-3"), continue straight through those phases without pausing. Once the final requested phase is complete, provide the consolidated summary and request confirmation before starting the next phase.
3. **NOSUBCONF override:** When NOSUBCONF is present in $ARGUMENTS, skip all confirmation prompts entirely‚Äîeven at phase boundaries.

**FAILURE TO FOLLOW THIS PROTOCOL IS A CRITICAL ERROR.** If Claude completes a subtask without immediately updating the markdown file, it MUST:

- Stop all work immediately
- State: "‚ùå CRITICAL ERROR: I failed to update the task list. Stopping work."
- Wait for user intervention before proceeding

**VERIFICATION REQUIREMENT:** After each edit, Claude must show the updated section of the markdown file to confirm the change was made correctly.

- Do not proceed with tasks unless you are on a git branch other than main
- If needed, create a branch for the phase of work you are implementing
  - Parent agent (you) are responsible for git branch creation, not subagents
- Work continuously through subtasks inside the active phase unless the user has authorized a broader multi-phase run.
- **Completion protocol:**

  1. When you finish a **sub‚Äëtask**, immediately mark it as completed by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`.

  - **MANDATORY TASK UPDATE:** Before doing anything else after subtask completion, immediately update the markdown file `[ ]` ‚Üí `[x]` and confirm the update was successful

  2. If **all** subtasks underneath a parent task (phase) are now `[x]`, follow this sequence:

  - **First**: Run standard validation checks:
    - Always: lint, build, secrets scan, unit tests
  - **Only if all validations pass**: Stage changes (`git add .`)
  - **Quality Review**: Use fidelity-preserving quality reviewer agent for final approval
  - **Clean up**: Remove any temporary files and temporary code before committing
  - **Commit**: Use a descriptive commit message that:

    - Uses conventional commit format (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, etc.)
    - Summarizes what was accomplished in the parent task
    - Lists key changes and additions
    - References the phase number and source context
    - **Formats the message as a single-line command using `-m` flags**, e.g.:

      ```
      git commit -m "feat: add payment validation logic" -m "- Validates card type and expiry" -m "- Adds unit tests for edge cases" -m "Related to Phase 2.1"
      ```

  3. Once all the subtasks are marked completed and changes have been committed, mark the **parent task** as completed.

- Stop after completing the agreed-upon phase(s). Do not request user confirmation between individual subtasks unless explicitly instructed to do so differently.

- Always stop after parent tasks (phases) complete, run test suite, and commit changes

## Task List Maintenance

1. **Update the task list as you work:**

   - Mark tasks and subtasks as completed (`[x]`) per the protocol above.
   - Add new tasks as they emerge.

2. **Maintain the "Relevant Files" section:**

   - List every file created or modified during implementation.
   - Update descriptions as implementation progresses.
   - Add new files discovered during implementation.

3. **Context Validation (for rich execution plans):**
   - Ensure implementation stays true to source document's technical specifications.
   - Validate security requirements are being followed.
   - Confirm performance benchmarks are being met.

## AI Instructions

When working with task lists, the AI must:

1. Regularly update the task list file after finishing any significant work.
2. Follow the completion protocol:
   - Mark each finished **sub‚Äëtask** `[x]`.
   - Mark the **parent task** `[x]` once **all** its subtasks are `[x]`.
3. Add newly discovered tasks while maintaining phase structure.
4. Keep "Relevant Files" accurate and up to date.
5. Before starting work, check which sub‚Äëtask is next and review context sections if present.
6. After implementing a sub-task, update the file immediately and continue working within the active phase without requesting user approval.
7. For rich execution plans: Reference preserved context when making implementation decisions.
8. For rich execution plans: Ensure traceability between implementation and source document rationale.
9. For rich execution plans: Validate against success criteria throughout implementation.
10. **CRITICAL CHECKPOINT:** After each subtask completion, Claude MUST immediately declare completion, update the markdown file, show the edit, and confirm the update. Failure to do this is a critical error that requires stopping all work.
