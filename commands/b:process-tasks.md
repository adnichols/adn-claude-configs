description: Process tasks in a task list with router-driven complexity detection and agent selection
argument-hint: [Files]

# Instructions

Process the task list using the complexity inheritance router to automatically detect complexity level, select appropriate developer and quality agents, and apply complexity-appropriate validation requirements. This command handles both simple task lists and complex execution plans with rich context from source documents (PRDs, research plans, etc.).
$ARGUMENTS. Think harder.

## Router Integration Process

Before starting task implementation:

1. **Parse Task File Metadata:** Extract complexity information from task file YAML front-matter
2. **Call Complexity Router:** Execute `python3 scripts/route_complexity.py [task-file]` to get:
   - Computed complexity level
   - Selected developer and quality-reviewer agents  
   - Required validation checks for the complexity level
   - Performance and security requirements
3. **Auto-select Agents:** Use router-selected agents for implementation:
   - Developer agent: `@[router-selected-developer]`
   - Quality reviewer: `@[router-selected-quality-reviewer]`
4. **Apply Validation Requirements:** Include complexity-appropriate checks:
   - **Minimum:** lint + build + secrets scan
   - **Basic:** + unit-core + dependency audit
   - **Moderate:** + integration tests + performance smoke + basic SAST
   - **Complex:** + e2e + performance benchmark + SAST+DAST + SBOM

# Task List Management

Guidelines for managing task lists in markdown files to track progress on completing source document implementations

## Task Implementation

## Critical Task Update Protocol

**MANDATORY CHECKPOINT SYSTEM:** After completing ANY subtask, Claude MUST follow this exact sequence:

1. **Declare completion with mandatory update statement:**
   "‚úÖ Subtask [X.Y] [task name] completed.
   üîÑ UPDATING MARKDOWN FILE NOW..."

2. **Immediately perform the markdown update:**
- Use Edit tool to change `- [ ] X.Y [task name]` to `- [x] X.Y [task name]`
- Show the actual edit operation in the response

3. **Confirm update completion:**
   "‚úÖ Markdown file updated: [ ] ‚Üí [x] for subtask X.Y
   üìã Task list is now current."

4. **Request permission to proceed (unless NOSUBCONF specified):**
   "Ready to proceed to next subtask. May I continue? (y/n)"

**FAILURE TO FOLLOW THIS PROTOCOL IS A CRITICAL ERROR.** If Claude completes a subtask without immediately updating the markdown file, it MUST:
- Stop all work immediately
- State: "‚ùå CRITICAL ERROR: I failed to update the task list. Stopping work."
- Wait for user intervention before proceeding

**VERIFICATION REQUIREMENT:** After each edit, Claude must show the updated section of the markdown file to confirm the change was made correctly.

- Do not proceed with tasks unless you are on a git branch other than main
- If needed, create a branch for the phase of work you are implementing
  - Parent agent (you) are responsible for git branch creation, not subagents
- **One sub-task at a time:** Do **NOT** start the next sub‚Äëtask until you ask the user for permission and they say "yes" or "y" UNLESS NOSUBCONF is specified by the user
- **Completion protocol:**
  1. When you finish a **sub‚Äëtask**, immediately mark it as completed by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`.
  - **MANDATORY TASK UPDATE:** Before doing anything else after subtask completion, immediately update the markdown file `[ ]` ‚Üí `[x]` and confirm the update was successful
  2. If **all** subtasks underneath a parent task are now `[x]`, follow this sequence:
  - **First**: Run complexity-appropriate validation checks (from router requirements):
    - Always: lint, build, secrets scan
    - Basic+: unit tests, dependency audit  
    - Moderate+: integration tests, performance smoke tests, basic SAST
    - Complex: e2e tests, performance benchmarks, advanced security scans
  - **Only if all validations pass**: Stage changes (`git add .`)
  - **Quality Review**: Use router-selected quality reviewer agent for final approval
  - **Clean up**: Remove any temporary files and temporary code before committing
  - **Commit**: Use a descriptive commit message that:
    - Uses conventional commit format (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, etc.)
    - Summarizes what was accomplished in the parent task
    - Lists key changes and additions
    - References the phase number and source context
    - **Formats the message as a single-line command using `-m` flags**, e.g.:

      ```
      git commit -m "feat: add payment validation logic" -m "- Validates card type and expiry" -m "- Adds unit tests for edge cases" -m "Related to Phase 2.1"
      ```
  3. Once all the subtasks are marked completed and changes have been committed, mark the **parent task** as completed.

- Stop after each sub‚Äëtask and wait for the user's go‚Äëahead UNLESS NOSUBCONF is specified by the user

- Always stop after parent tasks complete, run test suite, and commit changes

## Task List Maintenance

1. **Update the task list as you work:**
   - Mark tasks and subtasks as completed (`[x]`) per the protocol above.
   - Add new tasks as they emerge.

2. **Maintain the "Relevant Files" section:**
   - List every file created or modified during implementation.
   - Update descriptions as implementation progresses.
   - Add new files discovered during implementation.

3. **Context Validation (for rich execution plans):**
   - Ensure implementation stays true to source document's technical specifications.
   - Validate security requirements are being followed.
   - Confirm performance benchmarks are being met.

## AI Instructions

When working with task lists, the AI must:

1. Regularly update the task list file after finishing any significant work.
2. Follow the completion protocol:
   - Mark each finished **sub‚Äëtask** `[x]`.
   - Mark the **parent task** `[x]` once **all** its subtasks are `[x]`.
3. Add newly discovered tasks while maintaining phase structure.
4. Keep "Relevant Files" accurate and up to date.
5. Before starting work, check which sub‚Äëtask is next and review context sections if present.
6. After implementing a sub‚Äëtask, update the file and then pause for user approval.
7. For rich execution plans: Reference preserved context when making implementation decisions.
8. For rich execution plans: Ensure traceability between implementation and source document rationale.
9. For rich execution plans: Validate against success criteria throughout implementation.
10. **CRITICAL CHECKPOINT:** After each subtask completion, Claude MUST immediately declare completion, update the markdown file, show the edit, confirm the update, and request permission to continue. Failure to do this is a critical error that requires stopping all work.
