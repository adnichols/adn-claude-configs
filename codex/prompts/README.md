> 📌 Codex only indexes prompt files that live directly under `~/.codex/prompts` (or a project-level `.codex/prompts`).
> To preserve category structure without folders we encode namespaces, phases, and steps directly in the filename using colon-delimited segments.

## Command Relationships

### Workflow 1: PRD-Based Development (Fidelity-Preserving)
```
prd:1:create-prd → prd:2:gen-tasks → prd:3:process-tasks → doc:update
```
- Create a PRD for a feature with exact scope preservation
- Generate task list using `prd:2:gen-tasks` with fidelity-preserving approach
- Process tasks using `prd:3:process-tasks` with fidelity agents
- Generate documentation after implementation using `doc:update`

### Workflow 2: Specification-Driven Development
```
spec:1:create-spec → spec:2:gen-tasks → spec:3:process-tasks → doc:update
```
- Start with research and generate technical specification
- Convert specification to executable tasks (preserves 100% fidelity)
- Process tasks using `spec:3:process-tasks` with fidelity-preserving agents
- Document the completed implementation

### Workflow 3: Code Simplification
```
simplify:1:create-plan → [Review/Approval] → simplify:2:process-plan
```
- Analyze codebase for simplification opportunities using `simplify:1:create-plan`
- Get approval for changes from quality-reviewer or stakeholders
- Execute the approved simplification plan using `simplify:2:process-plan`

### Workflow 4: Documentation Management
```
doc:fetch → [Development] → doc:update
```
- Fetch documentation for libraries/frameworks using `doc:fetch` or `doc:fetch-batch`
- Complete feature development
- Update project documentation using `doc:update`

## Key Features

### Fidelity-Preserving Approach
All commands now follow strict fidelity preservation:
- **Exact Scope Implementation**: Build only what's specified in source documents
- **No Scope Creep**: Zero additions beyond explicit requirements
- **Fidelity Agents**: Always use developer-fidelity and quality-reviewer-fidelity
- **Question Ambiguity**: Ask for clarification rather than making assumptions

### Standardized Format
All commands use consistent:
- **Phase Structure**: `Phase N: [Name] (Timeframe)`
- **Task Format**: `N.0 [Parent]` → `N.1, N.2, N.3 [Sub-tasks]`
- **Commit Messages**: `git commit -m "feat: [summary]" -m "Related to Phase X.Y"`

### Enhanced Capabilities
- Git branch management
- Test suite integration (only as specified)
- Context-aware implementation
- Scope boundary enforcement
- Progress tracking and validation

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Use Each Prompt

**`prd:1:create-prd`**:
- New feature development from scratch
- Clear, scoped requirements
- Need to ask clarifying questions about requirements
- Want exact scope preservation

**`prd:2:gen-tasks`**:
- Converting PRDs to actionable development tasks with fidelity preservation
- Creating task lists that implement only specified requirements
- Using fidelity-preserving agents
- No scope expansion or assumptions beyond PRD content

**`prd:3:process-tasks`**:
- Execute PRD-based task lists
- Uses fidelity-preserving agents for implementation
- Requires git branch (not main)
- Implements only what's specified in PRD

**`spec:1:create-spec`**:
- Complex technical implementations
- Architecture-heavy projects
- Need for research and context gathering
- Generating detailed specifications

**`spec:2:gen-tasks`**:
- Convert specifications to executable tasks
- Absolute fidelity preservation - no scope changes or additions
- Direct conversion from spec to tasks
- Uses fidelity-preserving agents

**`spec:3:process-tasks`**:
- Execute specification-based task lists
- Uses fidelity-preserving agents for implementation
- Requires git branch (not main)
- Supports `NOSUBCONF` for batch processing

**`doc:fetch`**:
- Fetch documentation for a single library/framework
- AI-friendly markdown format
- Stored in project docs directory

**`doc:fetch-batch`**:
- Batch fetch documentation from markdown lists
- Process multiple libraries at once
- Supports parallel processing

**`doc:update`**:
- Post-implementation documentation
- User guides and technical references
- API documentation generation
- After feature completion

**`simplify:1:create-plan`** & **`simplify:2:process-plan`**:
- Code complexity reduction
- Technical debt management
- Refactoring legacy systems
- Performance optimization through simplification

**`cmd:commit-push`**:
- Commit all changes and push to remote
- Simple git workflow automation

**`cmd:create-pr`**:
- Create pull request with changelog
- Automated PR creation

## Fidelity-Preserving Agents

### developer-fidelity
- Implements EXACTLY what's specified in source documents
- Adds NO tests, security, or features beyond specification requirements
- Questions ambiguity rather than making assumptions
- Used by `plan:spec-to-tasks` workflow

### quality-reviewer-fidelity  
- Reviews implementation against specification requirements ONLY
- Does NOT require additional security, testing, or compliance beyond specification
- Validates fidelity preservation and prevents scope creep
- Used by `plan:spec-to-tasks` workflow

### Best Practices

1. **Always work on feature branches** (not main)
2. **One sub-task at a time** unless `NOSUBCONF` specified
3. **Test before commit** - all commands enforce test passing
4. **Context preservation** - rich execution plans maintain full context
5. **Progress tracking** - regular task list updates required

## Fidelity & Execution House Rules

These rules apply to all fidelity‑oriented prompts (`prd:*`, `spec:*`, `3:process-tasks`, `simplify:*`, and related commands):

- **Fidelity**
  - Treat the source document (user input, PRD, spec, or task file) as the single source of truth.
  - Do not add requirements, tests, or security work beyond what is explicitly specified.
  - Do not broaden scope; when in doubt, ask for clarification instead of guessing.

- **Execution**
  - Work on a non‑`main` branch for any code changes; create a branch if needed.
  - Run the repository’s primary tests (and any task‑specific checks) before committing.
  - When working from task lists or simplification plans:
    - After completing a listed sub‑task/step, immediately change its checkbox from `[ ]` to `[x]` in the same file and verify the change.
    - Avoid batching checkbox updates; progress in the markdown file should reflect actual progress in real time.
    - Keep any “Relevant Files” sections accurate as files are created or modified.

## File Outputs

- **PRDs**: `/tasks/prd-[feature-name].md`
- **Execution Plans**: `/tasks/tasks-execution-[source-name].md`
- **Task Processing**: Updates existing task files in place

## Integration Notes

All commands integrate with:
- Git workflow and branching
- Test commands from `TESTING.md` or `CLAUDE.md`
- Conventional commit formatting
- Security and performance validation (where applicable)
