# Rule: Direct Specification to Task Conversion with Full Fidelity

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in converting a detailed specification document directly into executable task lists while preserving 100% fidelity to the original specification. This command maintains exact scope boundaries and requirements as specified.

## Core Principle: Specification Fidelity

**The specification is the absolute authority.** This command:

- Adds ZERO requirements beyond the specification
- Makes NO scope expansions or "improvements"
- Preserves ALL original decisions and constraints
- Creates tasks that implement EXACTLY what's written

## Input

The user will provide:

1. **Specification File Path:** Path to the detailed specification document. This may be provided in {{args}}

## Process

1. **Read Specification Completely:** Parse the entire specification document to understand:

   - All functional requirements
   - All technical constraints and decisions
   - Stated testing requirements (if any)
   - Stated security requirements (if any)
   - Performance requirements and success criteria
   - Implementation timeline and phases
   - Resource constraints
   - Explicit scope boundaries (what's included/excluded)

2. **Extract Task Structure:** Identify natural implementation phases from the specification:

   - Use specification's own phase structure if provided
   - Create logical groupings based on specification content
   - Maintain specification's dependencies
   - Preserve specification's success criteria for each phase

3. **Create and Save Task List:** Generate and save tasks that implement:

   - ONLY what's explicitly stated in the specification
   - Testing ONLY as specified (not more, not less)
   - Security ONLY as specified (not more, not less)
   - Performance measures ONLY as specified
   - Documentation ONLY as specified
   - Save tasks to `thoughts/plans/tasks-fidelity-[spec-name].md`

## Final Task File Format

The final task file at `thoughts/plans/tasks-fidelity-[spec-name].md`:

```markdown
# [Specification Title] - Fidelity Implementation Tasks

## 🎯 Implementation Authority

**Source Specification:** [path to spec file]
**Implementation Scope:** Exactly as specified, no additions or modifications

### Specification Summary

[Brief summary of what's being implemented - extracted from spec]

### Implementation Boundaries

**Included:** [What specification explicitly includes]
**Excluded:** [What specification explicitly excludes]
**Testing Level:** [As specified in original document]
**Security Level:** [As specified in original document]
**Documentation Level:** [As specified in original document]

## 🗂️ Implementation Files

[List of files that will need creation/modification based on specification analysis]

### Development Notes

- Follow specification requirements exactly as written
- Do not add testing beyond what's specified
- Do not add security measures beyond what's specified
- Do not expand scope or "improve" requirements without user approval
- Question any ambiguity rather than assuming

### Approval & Clarification Protocol

**When implementing agents encounter any of the following, they MUST stop and ask for user approval:**

1. **Scope Adjustments** - Any addition, removal, or modification to specified requirements
2. **Ambiguity** - Specification is unclear about implementation details
3. **Contradictions** - Specification conflicts with existing code patterns or constraints
4. **Technical Blockers** - A specified approach is infeasible or would cause issues
5. **Missing Information** - Critical details needed to proceed are not in the specification
6. **Better Alternatives** - A clearly superior approach is discovered during implementation

## ⚙️ Implementation Phases

[Extract phases directly from specification structure]

### Phase 1: [Phase Name from Specification]

**Objective:** [Exact objective from specification]

**Specification Requirements:**
[List requirements exactly as written in specification]

**Tasks:**

- [ ] 1.0 [High-level task matching specification]
  - [ ] 1.1 [Specific implementation task from spec]
  - [ ] 1.2 [Another specific task from spec]
  - [ ] 1.3 [Validation task as specified]

### Phase N: Final Phase

**Objective:** Complete implementation as specified

**Tasks:**

- [ ] N.0 Finalize Implementation
  - [ ] N.1 Complete all specified deliverables
  - [ ] N.2 Validate against specification success criteria
  - [ ] N.3 Document implementation (if specified in original spec)

## 🚨 Implementation Requirements

### Fidelity Requirements (MANDATORY)

- Implement ONLY what's explicitly specified
- Do not add features, tests, or security beyond specification
- Question ambiguities rather than making assumptions
- Preserve all specification constraints and limitations

### Success Criteria

[Extract success criteria exactly from specification]

## ✅ Validation Checklist

- [ ] Implementation matches specification exactly
- [ ] No scope additions or "improvements" made
- [ ] All specification constraints preserved
- [ ] Success criteria from specification met
```

## Key Principles

1. **Absolute Fidelity:** The specification is the complete and sole authority
2. **Zero Additions:** No requirements, tests, or features beyond specification
3. **Preserve Constraints:** Maintain all limitations and boundaries from specification
4. **Context Preservation:** Include necessary specification context in task file

## ➡️ Next Command

When the task list is complete and approved, run:
```
/dev:3:process-tasks [path-to-tasks]
