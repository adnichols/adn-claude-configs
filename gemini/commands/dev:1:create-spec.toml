# Rule: Research and Generate Specification Document

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in researching a user's idea and creating a focused, practical specification document in Markdown format with YAML front-matter. This document will serve as input to downstream task generation commands.

## Research Approach

This command uses a standard research depth approach to create comprehensive specification documents that include:

1. **Core functionality analysis** based on research findings and feature characteristics
2. **Appropriate technical depth** matching the requirements
3. **Integration considerations** for existing codebase patterns
4. **Standard quality requirements** for production-ready features

## Input

Consider any input from {{args}}

The user will provide:

1. **Idea/Feature Description:** Initial concept or problem statement that needs research

## Instructions

The AI will need to:

1. Analyze the user's idea for completeness and scope
2. Conduct comprehensive research on the feature
3. Ask clarifying questions if critical information is missing
4. Generate a complete specification document

## Process

1. **Initial Research:** Conduct preliminary research to understand the idea's scope and characteristics
2. **Documentation Discovery:** Identify and optionally fetch documentation for key technologies (see Documentation Discovery section below)
3. **Requirements Analysis:** Based on research findings:
   - Analyze impact scope and integration needs
   - Identify functional requirements
   - Assess technical constraints and decisions
   - Evaluate integration complexity
4. **Deep Research Phase:** Conduct comprehensive research covering:
   - Core functionality and integration patterns
   - Testing approaches and security considerations
   - Performance considerations and reliability features
   - Implementation planning and dependencies
5. **Generate Specification:** Create complete document with all necessary sections
6. **Save Specification:** Save as `spec-[idea-name].md` in `thoughts/specs/` directory
7. **End Command:** The command completes after saving the specification.

## Documentation Discovery

After Initial Research identifies the technologies involved, proactively evaluate documentation needs before proceeding with deep research.

### Step 1: Identify Key Technologies

From Initial Research findings, extract:
- **Frameworks**: React, Vue, Next.js, Express, FastAPI, etc.
- **Libraries**: Lodash, Axios, Zod, Prisma, etc.
- **Languages/Runtimes**: TypeScript, Python, Rust, Node.js, etc.
- **Infrastructure**: PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker, Kubernetes, etc.

Focus on technologies that are:
- Core to the feature implementation
- Not already well-understood from codebase patterns
- Likely to require API reference during implementation

### Step 2: Check Existing Documentation

Check the `docs/` directory for existing documentation:

```bash
ls -la docs/
```

Also check CLAUDE.md's "Available Documentation" section for reference.

### Step 3: Assess Documentation Needs

For each identified technology, determine:
1. **Already Available**: Documentation exists in `docs/` - no action needed
2. **Codebase Sufficient**: Existing code provides enough patterns - no action needed
3. **Should Fetch**: Would benefit from official documentation - offer to fetch
4. **Manual Required**: Documentation source not supported - guide user

### Step 4: Request User Permission

Ask the user if they want documentation fetched:

"Should I fetch documentation for the following libraries to improve implementation guidance?
- [Library 1] - Available via Context7 MCP
- [Library 2] - Available via Context7 MCP
- [Library 3] - Requires manual URL (not in Context7)

You can select multiple, or skip documentation fetching."

### Step 5: Fetch or Guide

**If user approves fetching:**

For libraries available in Context7, use the `/doc:fetch` command:

```bash
/doc:fetch [library-name]
/doc:fetch [library-name] --version [version] --topic [topic]
```

Example:
```bash
/doc:fetch react --topic hooks
/doc:fetch prisma --version 5
/doc:fetch zod
```

**If documentation source is not available in Context7:**

Guide the user to fetch documentation manually:

"The documentation for [library] is not available in Context7.

To add it manually:
1. Find the official documentation URL
2. Run: /doc:fetch [library] --url [documentation-url]"

### Step 6: Continue with Research

After documentation is fetched (or skipped), proceed to Requirements Analysis with enhanced context.

## Research Areas

The research should comprehensively cover:

### Core Research (Always Include)

- Existing implementations and design patterns
- Framework and library recommendations (from current codebase)
- Integration with existing systems
- User journey and interface patterns
- Existing code patterns and conventions
- Available utilities and shared components

### Technical Research

- Data modeling requirements
- Security considerations (input validation, authentication, authorization)
- Testing approaches (unit, integration, e2e tests)
- Error handling patterns and edge cases
- Configuration and environment requirements
- **Identify paired dependencies requiring version alignment** (client/server packages, protocol pairs)
- **Flag infrastructure that may need smoke testing** before feature work

### Production Readiness Research

- Performance considerations and optimization opportunities
- Security best practices and compliance needs
- Reliability and resilience features
- Monitoring and observability requirements
- Deployment considerations and CI/CD integration
- Backward compatibility requirements (if applicable)

## Clarifying Questions (Only When Needed)

Ask questions when critical information is missing:

**If problem scope is unclear:**
"Which best describes your vision?
A) A simple feature addition to existing system
B) An enhancement to current functionality
C) A complete standalone application
D) A developer tool or utility"

**If target users are ambiguous:**
"Who is the primary user for this feature?
A) End users (customers/clients)
B) Internal team members
C) Developers/technical users
D) System administrators"

## Next Steps

### Recommended: Multi-Model Review

Before generating tasks, consider having multiple AI models review the specification for critical feedback:

```bash
# Run in each tool (Claude, Gemini, Codex) to gather diverse perspectives
/review:spec thoughts/specs/spec-[idea-name].md
```

Each reviewer adds inline HTML comments with their identity (e.g., `<!-- [Gemini] ... -->`). Reviews can respond to each other's feedback.

After all reviews complete, integrate the feedback in Claude Code:
```bash
/review:spec-integrate thoughts/specs/spec-[idea-name].md
```

### Generate Tasks

When the specification is complete (and optionally reviewed), run:
```
/dev:2:gen-tasks thoughts/specs/spec-[idea-name].md
```
