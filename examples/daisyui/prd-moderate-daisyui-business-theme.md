# DaisyUI Business Theme Implementation - Product Requirements Document

## Introduction/Overview
Implement DaisyUI component library with the "business" theme to provide consistent, professional styling across all screens of the MCP Proxy Desktop application. This will replace the current custom Tailwind CSS implementation with a standardized component library while maintaining the existing dark/light theme functionality.

## Goals
- **Primary Objective**: Establish consistent UI design language across all application screens using DaisyUI business theme
- **User Experience Goal**: Improve visual consistency and professional appearance of the desktop application
- **Technical Objective**: Migrate from custom CSS/inline styles to standardized DaisyUI component system
- **Maintenance Goal**: Reduce custom CSS maintenance overhead by leveraging established component library

## User Stories
### Primary User Stories
- As a user, I want all screens to have a consistent, professional appearance so that the application feels cohesive and polished
- As a user, I want the dark/light theme toggle to work seamlessly with the new design so that I can maintain my preferred viewing experience

### Secondary User Stories
- As a developer, I want to use standardized components so that I can develop new features more efficiently
- As a designer, I want consistent styling patterns so that future UI improvements follow established design principles

## Functional Requirements
### Core Requirements
1. The system must integrate DaisyUI library with the existing React + Tauri application stack
2. The system must apply the "business" theme consistently across all existing screens:
   - ServerList component and server status displays
   - ServerConfig component including forms and validation states
   - StatusDisplay component and system information panels
   - ThemeToggle component and settings interfaces
3. The system must maintain compatibility with the existing dark/light theme switching functionality
4. The system must preserve all existing functionality while updating visual presentation

### Extended Requirements
5. The system should replace custom button classes with DaisyUI button components
6. The system should replace custom form elements with DaisyUI form components
7. The system should replace custom card layouts with DaisyUI card components
8. The system should replace custom alert/status indicators with DaisyUI alert components

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
- Adding new functionality beyond existing features
- Changing the application's information architecture or navigation
- Implementing additional DaisyUI themes beyond the business theme
- Backend or API modifications

## Design Considerations
### User Interface
- Maintain current layout structures while upgrading component styling
- Preserve accessibility features and keyboard navigation patterns
- Ensure proper contrast ratios and visual hierarchy with business theme
- Keep existing responsive design patterns

### User Experience
- Seamless transition from current styling without functionality disruption
- Preserve user familiarity with existing interface patterns
- Maintain fast loading times and smooth theme transitions

## Technical Considerations
### Architecture
- Integration with existing Tailwind CSS 4.x configuration
- Compatibility with current theme context and CSS variable system
- Preservation of existing component prop interfaces

### DaisyUI Integration
- Configure DaisyUI business theme in tailwind.config.js
- Map existing theme variables to DaisyUI theme tokens
- Ensure proper CSS cascade order for theme overrides

### Performance
- Minimal impact on bundle size with tree-shaking
- Maintain current rendering performance
- Preserve theme switching performance

## Edge Cases & Error Handling
- Handle cases where DaisyUI components don't perfectly match existing layouts
- Ensure graceful fallback if theme loading fails
- Maintain component functionality if DaisyUI CSS fails to load

## Dependencies
### Technical Dependencies
- DaisyUI npm package installation and configuration
- Tailwind CSS 4.x compatibility verification
- No conflicts with existing CSS framework usage

### Team Dependencies
- Design approval of business theme application
- QA validation of visual consistency across all screens

## Success Metrics
### Quantitative Metrics
- 100% of existing components successfully migrated to DaisyUI equivalents
- Zero regression in existing functionality during migration
- Theme switching performance maintains < 200ms transition time

### Qualitative Metrics
- Visual consistency across all application screens
- Professional, cohesive appearance aligned with business theme standards

## Testing Approach
- Visual regression testing across all screens and components
- Dark/light theme switching validation with business theme
- Cross-platform testing (Windows, macOS, Linux) for Tauri desktop app
- Accessibility testing to ensure no degradation of existing a11y features

## Open Questions
- Are there specific business theme customizations needed beyond default DaisyUI business theme?
- Should any existing custom components be preserved due to unique functionality requirements?
