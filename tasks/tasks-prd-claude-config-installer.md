## Relevant Files

- `install.sh` - Main installation script for Claude Code configuration linking. Fully implemented with foundation, backup, symlink creation, user interaction, and cross-platform compatibility.
- `test_install.sh` - Comprehensive test script to verify installation functionality across platforms and scenarios.

### Notes

- Use test commands defined in TESTING.md or CLAUDE.md.
