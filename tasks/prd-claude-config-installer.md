# PRD: Claude Code Configuration Installation Script

## Introduction/Overview

This feature provides a portable installation script that allows users to easily set up their Claude Code configuration by linking their global Claude configuration directories to a cloned configuration repository. The script will safely backup existing configurations and create symbolic links from `~/.claude/agents` and `~/.claude/commands` to the corresponding directories in the repository.

## Goals

1. Enable easy sharing and installation of Claude Code configurations across different machines
2. Safely backup existing user configurations before replacement
3. Create a seamless linking mechanism between the repository and global Claude configuration
4. Provide clear feedback to users about each step of the installation process
5. Support both macOS and Linux environments

## User Stories

- As a Claude Code user, I want to easily install a shared configuration repository so that I can use pre-built agents and commands without manual setup
- As a configuration maintainer, I want to provide a simple installation method so that others can quickly adopt my Claude Code setup
- As a user, I want my existing configurations safely backed up so that I can restore them if needed
- As a user, I want clear feedback during installation so that I understand what changes are being made to my system

## Functional Requirements

1. The script must be executed from within the cloned repository directory
2. The script must verify that the repository contains both `agents/` and `commands/` directories before proceeding
3. The script must analyze existing `~/.claude/agents` and `~/.claude/commands` paths and inform the user what actions will be taken (e.g., "Will backup directory agents/" or "Will remove existing symlink commands") before prompting for confirmation
4. The script must backup existing `~/.claude/agents` and `~/.claude/commands` directories using timestamp-based naming (e.g., `agents.backup.20240829-143022`)
5. The script must create the `~/.claude` directory if it doesn't exist
6. The script must create symbolic links from `~/.claude/agents` to `(repo)/agents`
7. The script must create symbolic links from `~/.claude/commands` to `(repo)/commands`
8. The script must remove existing symbolic links (no backup needed for symlinks)
9. The script must abort installation if backup operations fail
10. The script must provide verbose output showing each step of the process
11. The script must work on both macOS and Linux systems
12. The script must validate successful symlink creation before completing

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Windows support in initial version
- Settings file linking or backup
- Automatic restoration functionality
- Remote repository cloning (users clone manually first)
- Configuration validation beyond directory existence
- GUI interface
- Package manager integration

## Design Considerations

- Script should be named `install.sh` or similar for clarity
- Use POSIX-compliant shell scripting for maximum compatibility
- Include clear success/failure messages with color coding if possible
- Provide absolute paths in all output for user clarity

## Technical Considerations

- Must handle symbolic links properly using `ln -sf`
- Should use `readlink` to resolve existing symlinks before backup
- Timestamp format should be `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS` for consistent sorting
- Directory existence checks using `[ -d ]`
- Repository validation should check for both target directories
- Error handling should use proper exit codes

## Success Metrics

- Users can successfully install configurations with zero manual symlink creation
- 100% of existing configurations are safely backed up before replacement
- Installation completes without errors on both macOS and Linux
- Users report high confidence in the safety of the installation process

## Open Questions

- Should the script provide an option to uninstall (remove symlinks and restore backups)?
- Should there be a way to verify the integrity of the linked configurations after installation?
- How should the script handle partial installations (e.g., only agents directory exists in repo)?
