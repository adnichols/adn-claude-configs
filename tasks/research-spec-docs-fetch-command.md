# Claude Code Documentation Fetch Command - Research Specification

## üéØ Executive Summary

The `docs:fetch` Claude Code command is a specialized slash command that programmatically researches, fetches, and curates documentation for programming libraries, frameworks, coding languages, and toolsets. Unlike a standalone system, this command integrates directly into the Claude Code workflow, transforming scattered online documentation into locally stored, AI-friendly Markdown files within the `/workspace/docs/` directory. This enhances Claude Code's ability to provide accurate, current guidance on best practices and implementation details for any technology stack.

The command follows Claude Code's established command patterns, utilizing the Technical Writer agent for content organization and integrating with the existing git workflow for version control and change tracking.

## üìä Problem Statement & Opportunity

### Problem Analysis

**Core Problem**: Developers using Claude Code lose productivity when Claude lacks current knowledge about libraries, frameworks, or languages, requiring manual context switching to external documentation sites and manual copying of relevant information back into the development environment.

**Specific Pain Points**:
1. **Knowledge Staleness**: Claude's training cutoff prevents access to latest documentation
2. **Context Loss**: Switching between Claude Code and browser breaks development flow
3. **Manual Curation**: Developers must manually identify and copy relevant documentation
4. **Format Inconsistency**: External docs don't match Claude Code's expected markdown structure
5. **No Persistence**: Research efforts aren't saved for future reference

### Target Users

**Primary Users**: Developers actively using Claude Code who encounter:
- New library versions with updated APIs
- Frameworks with evolving best practices
- Technologies outside Claude's training data
- Complex libraries requiring comprehensive reference material

**Use Case Scenarios**:
- Learning new React hooks or patterns introduced after training cutoff
- Working with specialized libraries (ML frameworks, database ORMs)
- Understanding deprecations and migration paths in updated libraries
- Accessing current API documentation for third-party services

### Success Metrics

**Command Effectiveness**:
- Successfully fetch documentation from 90%+ of popular documentation sites
- Generate well-structured Markdown that improves Claude Code response quality
- Complete typical library documentation fetch in under 3 minutes
- Achieve 95%+ content accuracy compared to source documentation

**User Productivity Impact**:
- Reduce external documentation lookup time by 80%
- Eliminate context switching for documentation research
- Enable Claude Code to provide more accurate, current technical guidance
- Create reusable documentation cache for team sharing

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Recommended Approach
