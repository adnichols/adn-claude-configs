# Claude Code Documentation Fetch Command - Execution Plan

## 🎯 Executive Summary

The `docs:fetch` Claude Code command is a specialized slash command that programmatically researches, fetches, and curates documentation for programming libraries, frameworks, coding languages, and toolsets. Unlike a standalone system, this command integrates directly into the Claude Code workflow, transforming scattered online documentation into locally stored, AI-friendly Markdown files within the `/workspace/docs/` directory. This enhances Claude Code's ability to provide accurate, current guidance on best practices and implementation details for any technology stack.

The command follows Claude Code's established command patterns, utilizing the Technical Writer agent for content organization and integrating with the existing git workflow for version control and change tracking.

## 📋 Context & Background

### Analysis & Requirements

**Core Problem**: Developers using Claude Code lose productivity when Claude lacks current knowledge about libraries, frameworks, or languages, requiring manual context switching to external documentation sites and manual copying of relevant information back into the development environment.

**Claude Code Command Ecosystem in 2025**:
- Custom slash commands stored in `.claude/commands/` as markdown files
- Commands follow structured patterns with `---` front-matter for descriptions
- Integration with specialized agents (technical-writer, quality-reviewer, etc.)
- Workflow integration with git branching and testing requirements
- Support for `$ARGUMENTS` parameter passing from command invocation

**Documentation Challenges Addressable by Commands**:
- Knowledge cutoff limitations requiring fresh documentation access
- Context switching between IDE and external documentation sites
- Inconsistent documentation quality across different projects
- Time-consuming manual research disrupting development flow
- Need for AI-optimized format to improve Claude Code's understanding

### Key Requirements

**Command-Centric Architecture**:
The solution is implemented as a single Claude Code command (`docs:fetch`) that orchestrates the entire documentation research and curation process within the established command framework.

**Core Processing Pipeline**:
1. **Parameter Processing**: Parse library/framework name and optional parameters
2. **Source Discovery**: Identify official documentation URLs and site patterns
3. **Content Fetching**: Use appropriate scraping method based on site type
4. **Content Processing**: Convert HTML to AI-friendly Markdown format
5. **Organization**: Structure content using Technical Writer agent patterns
6. **Storage**: Save to `/workspace/docs/` with consistent naming conventions

**Command Invocation Patterns**:
```bash
/docs:fetch react                    # Fetch React documentation
/docs:fetch typescript --version 5.3 # Specific version
/docs:fetch lodash --sections api    # API reference only
/docs:fetch vue --update             # Update existing docs
/docs:fetch express --format minimal # Condensed format
```

### Security Considerations

**Safe Operation Requirements**:
- Respect robots.txt and rate limiting to avoid IP blocking
- No authentication credential storage or transmission
- Content validation to prevent malicious script injection
- Sandboxed execution environment for scraping operations
- Local-only storage with no external data transmission

**Operational Security**:
- Rate limiting with intelligent backoff strategies
- User-Agent rotation to avoid automated blocking
- Timeout and retry logic with exponential backoff
- No persistent connections or session storage

**Content Security**:
- HTML sanitization before markdown conversion
- Link validation and broken link detection
- Source verification against official documentation sites
- Content integrity checks during processing

### Performance & Quality Requirements

**Execution Performance Targets**:
- Small libraries (lodash, moment): < 1 minute
- Medium libraries (React, Vue): < 2 minutes
- Large frameworks (Angular, Next.js): < 4 minutes
- API-heavy libraries: < 2 minutes

**Resource Efficiency**:
- Memory usage under 256MB during operation
