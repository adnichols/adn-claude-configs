# Claude Code Documentation Fetch Command - Execution Plan

## 🎯 Executive Summary

The `docs:fetch` Claude Code command is a specialized slash command that programmatically researches, fetches, and curates documentation for programming libraries, frameworks, coding languages, and toolsets. Unlike a standalone system, this command integrates directly into the Claude Code workflow, transforming scattered online documentation into locally stored, AI-friendly Markdown files within the `/workspace/docs/` directory. This enhances Claude Code's ability to provide accurate, current guidance on best practices and implementation details for any technology stack.

The command follows Claude Code's established command patterns, utilizing the Technical Writer agent for content organization and integrating with the existing git workflow for version control and change tracking.

## 📋 Context & Background

### Analysis & Requirements

**Specific Pain Points Addressed**:
1. **Knowledge Staleness**: Claude's training cutoff prevents access to latest documentation
2. **Context Loss**: Switching between Claude Code and browser breaks development flow
3. **Manual Curation**: Developers must manually identify and copy relevant documentation
4. **Format Inconsistency**: External docs don't match Claude Code's expected markdown structure
5. **No Persistence**: Research efforts aren't saved for future reference

**Target Use Case Scenarios**:
- Learning new React hooks or patterns introduced after training cutoff
- Working with specialized libraries (ML frameworks, database ORMs)
- Understanding deprecations and migration paths in updated libraries
- Accessing current API documentation for third-party services

### Analysis & Requirements

**Core Problem**: Developers using Claude Code lose productivity when Claude lacks current knowledge about libraries, frameworks, or languages, requiring manual context switching to external documentation sites and manual copying of relevant information back into the development environment.

**Claude Code Command Ecosystem in 2025**:
- Custom slash commands stored in `.claude/commands/` as markdown files
- Commands follow structured patterns with `---` front-matter for descriptions
- Integration with specialized agents (technical-writer, quality-reviewer, etc.)
- Workflow integration with git branching and testing requirements
- Support for `$ARGUMENTS` parameter passing from command invocation

**Documentation Challenges Addressable by Commands**:
- Knowledge cutoff limitations requiring fresh documentation access
- Context switching between IDE and external documentation sites
- Inconsistent documentation quality across different projects
- Time-consuming manual research disrupting development flow
- Need for AI-optimized format to improve Claude Code's understanding

### Key Requirements

**Command-Centric Architecture**:
The solution is implemented as a single Claude Code command (`docs:fetch`) that orchestrates the entire documentation research and curation process within the established command framework.

**Core Processing Pipeline**:
1. **Parameter Processing**: Parse library/framework name and optional parameters
2. **Source Discovery**: Identify official documentation URLs and site patterns
3. **Content Fetching**: Use appropriate scraping method based on site type
4. **Content Processing**: Convert HTML to AI-friendly Markdown format
5. **Organization**: Structure content using Technical Writer agent patterns
6. **Storage**: Save to `/workspace/docs/` with consistent naming conventions

**Command Invocation Patterns**:
```bash
/docs:fetch react                    # Fetch React documentation
/docs:fetch typescript --version 5.3 # Specific version
/docs:fetch lodash --sections api    # API reference only
/docs:fetch vue --update             # Update existing docs
/docs:fetch express --format minimal # Condensed format
```

**Expected Execution Flow**:
1. **Parameter Validation**: Confirm library name and process options
2. **Source Discovery**: "Discovering official documentation sources for React..."
3. **Content Analysis**: "Analyzing site structure and identifying key sections..."
4. **Fetching Progress**: "Fetching API documentation... (3/7 sections complete)"
5. **Processing**: "Converting to AI-friendly Markdown format..."
6. **Organization**: "Organizing content with Technical Writer agent..."
7. **Completion**: "Documentation saved to /workspace/docs/libraries/react/"

**Progress Feedback Requirements**:
- Real-time progress indicators for multi-step operations
- Clear section-by-section progress for large documentation sets
- Error handling with specific troubleshooting guidance
- Success confirmation with file locations and organization summary
- Content completeness percentage and quality metrics display

### Security Considerations
