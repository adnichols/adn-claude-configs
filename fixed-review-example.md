# Fixed Fidelity Review Output Example

## What the user should now see when fidelity review finds issues:

---

### Step 1: Draft Creation
```
✅ Draft task list saved to: /workspace/tasks/tasks-fidelity-consolidated-visual-testing-DRAFT.md
Running fidelity review...
```

### Step 2: COMPLETE Review Output Display

## ⚠️ Fidelity Review: ISSUES FOUND

**Files Reviewed:**
- **Specification:** /workspace/tasks/uibaseline/consolidated-visual-testing-spec.md
- **Draft Task List:** /workspace/tasks/tasks-fidelity-consolidated-visual-testing-DRAFT.md

*You can open both files to review the context for these issues.*

### ✅ Validated Elements
- **Browser Setup Requirements**: Correctly represented in tasks 1.1-1.3
- **Screenshot Capture Logic**: Properly scoped in task 2.1
- **Comparison Engine**: Accurately captured in task 3.1-3.2
- **Test Suite Integration**: Correctly included in tasks 4.1-4.3

### ❌ Issues Requiring Decisions

**1. Missing Requirement: Automatic Cleanup**
**Specification** (Cleanup and Maintenance section): "Automatic cleanup of old screenshots after 30 days"
**Draft Task List** (Task 5.0): Generic cleanup task without specific retention period
**Issue:** Missing explicit 30-day automatic cleanup requirement

Options:
a) Add task: "5.4 Implement automatic cleanup of screenshots older than 30 days"
b) Modify existing task 5.1 to include "with 30-day retention policy"
c) This requirement is covered by general maintenance tasks
d) Add this as configuration option rather than hardcoded 30 days

**2. Ambiguous Requirement: Anti-Flakiness Patterns**
**Specification** (Quality Requirements): "Implement anti-flakiness patterns"
**Draft Task List** (Task 2.2): "Add stability measures" (no specificity)
**Issue:** Specification mentions anti-flakiness but doesn't specify which patterns

Options:
a) Interpret as: "Add wait conditions and element stability checks"
b) Interpret as: "Implement retry mechanisms and error handling"
c) Split into multiple tasks covering different anti-flakiness approaches
d) Request clarification on specific patterns required

**3. Missing Requirement: Helper Functions**
**Specification** (Developer Experience section): "Provide helper functions for common screenshot scenarios"
**Draft Task List** (missing): No task for helper function creation
**Issue:** Specification requires helper functions but no corresponding task exists

Options:
a) Add task: "6.0 Create helper functions for common screenshot scenarios"
b) This is covered by the main API implementation
c) Add as subtask under existing API task
d) Mark as future enhancement outside core requirements

**4. Scope Addition: Performance Monitoring**
**Specification** (silent on monitoring): No mention of performance monitoring
**Draft Task List** (Task 7.1): "Add performance monitoring for screenshot operations"
**Issue:** Task adds monitoring not specified in requirements

Options:
a) Keep as is - performance monitoring enhances the implementation
b) Remove this task completely 
c) Modify to basic timing logs only
d) Mark as optional enhancement

**5. Ambiguous Requirement: Masking Filters**
**Specification** (Comparison Features): "Support for masking dynamic content"
**Draft Task List** (Task 3.3): "Implement content masking" (no detail on filters)
**Issue:** Unclear what types of masking filters are required

Options:
a) Interpret as: "Basic rectangular masking areas"
b) Interpret as: "CSS selector-based masking with multiple filter types"
c) Split into basic and advanced masking tasks
d) Request clarification on required masking capabilities

**6. Potential Future Phase Content: Advanced Features**
**Specification** (Future Enhancements section): Lists advanced features for "future phases"
**Draft Task List** (Tasks 8.1-8.3): Includes some future phase features in main implementation
**Issue:** Some future phase content appears in main task list

Options:
a) Move future phase tasks to separate "Phase 2" section
b) Remove future phase features entirely from current tasks
c) Mark future features as optional/stretch goals
d) Keep as is since specification mentions them

## What the user was seeing before (INCORRECT):

```
● The fidelity review has identified 6 issues requiring decisions. Please review the detailed comparison above and respond with your choices in the format: "1a, 2b, 3c, 4a, 5b, 6a" (issue number + letter choice).

The issues range from missing requirements (automatic cleanup, helper functions) to ambiguous implementation details (anti-flakiness patterns, masking filters) and scope boundaries (future phase content).
```

## The Fix:

Now the user sees ALL the detailed questions with specific references to both files, allowing them to make informed decisions by examining the actual specification and draft task list.
