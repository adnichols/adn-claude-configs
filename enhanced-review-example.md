# Enhanced Fidelity Review Example

## What the enhanced fidelity-reviewer would now output for Issue #1:

---

**1. Missing Requirement: Automatic Cleanup of Old Test Results**
**Specification** (line 604): "Automatic cleanup of old test results (configurable retention)"
**Draft Task List**: Missing - no task for configuring or implementing automatic cleanup
**Issue:** The specification mentions automatic cleanup of old test results with configurable retention, but this is not represented in any task.

**üîç Research Findings:**
- WebSearch: Searched "Playwright automatic cleanup test-results directory"
- Found: Playwright documentation does NOT mention automatic cleanup capabilities
- Checked: Official Playwright config options - no built-in retention settings
- Analyzed: Common CI/CD patterns show manual cleanup scripts are standard practice
- Context Analysis: This appears in "Security & Storage" section as actual requirement, not example

**üìä Analysis:**
- Playwright test-results directory grows indefinitely without manual intervention
- This is a real operational concern that will cause disk space issues over time
- Specification explicitly mentions "configurable retention" indicating this is intended feature
- Missing this requirement would violate specification fidelity
- Impact: Production deployments will accumulate test artifacts without cleanup

**‚úÖ Recommendation:** Option A - Add explicit cleanup task
**Confidence:** High
**Evidence:** No automatic cleanup found in Playwright v1.40+ documentation, explicit requirement in specification

Options:
a) Add task: "Configure automatic cleanup of old test results with retention settings" ‚Üê RECOMMENDED
b) Already covered by Playwright defaults (Research shows this is incorrect)
c) Defer as nice-to-have (Will cause operational issues - violates specification)
d) Other action

**2. Missing Requirement: Helper Function waitForDataLoaded**
**Specification** (lines 362-372): Shows complete implementation of waitForDataLoaded helper function
**Draft Task List** (Task 3.0): Lists helper tasks 3.1-3.6 but doesn't include waitForDataLoaded helper
**Issue:** The specification provides a complete implementation for a waitForDataLoaded helper function that's not included in the task list.

**üîç Research Findings:**
- Context Analysis: Function appears in "## üîÆ Future Scalability Patterns" section (line 441+)
- Grep: Searched spec for "waitForDataLoaded" - only appears in future patterns section
- Read: Examined surrounding context - this section explicitly marked "For Phase 2 and beyond"
- Pattern Analysis: Other functions in same section are also future-focused (component testing, POM)
- Specification structure: This is in "example" code block, not core requirements

**üìä Analysis:**
- Function only appears in future scalability patterns section
- Section is explicitly labeled for Phase 2+ implementation
- No references to this function in Phase 1 requirements
- Similar pattern to other future features correctly excluded from task list
- Functionality partially covered by waitForAppStable() in current task 3.5

**‚úÖ Recommendation:** Option B - This is future example, not current requirement
**Confidence:** High
**Evidence:** Function only appears in "Phase 2 and beyond" section, not in Phase 1 requirements

Options:
a) Add task 3.7: "Implement waitForDataLoaded() helper function"
b) This is a future example, not a Phase 1 requirement - exclude from tasks ‚Üê RECOMMENDED
c) Already covered by other wait functions in tasks 3.2-3.5
d) Other action

## Key Improvements:

1. **Research Evidence**: Agent investigated each issue using available tools
2. **Contextual Analysis**: Examined WHERE in specification things appear
3. **Clear Recommendations**: Based on evidence, not guesswork
4. **Confidence Levels**: You know how sure the agent is
5. **Actionable**: You can make informed decisions quickly

The agent now does the investigative work you shouldn't have to do!
